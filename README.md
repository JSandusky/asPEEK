# asPEEK

Copy of the asPEEK web-based debugging client. Originally authored by Muhammed Ikbal Akpaca and licensed as ZLib/libpng license.

This is just a debugging client and has to connect to a host to start debugging. An Urho3D based host can be found here: https://gist.github.com/JSandusky/51f12192f40b90b4a09ee9138820e74c (with protocol modifications for SETT/SETS/SETG to change variables).

This client is modified to support SETT/SETS.
